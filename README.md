# Ignite 2019 - Infrastructure as code with Terraform, Ansible, and ARM Pre-Day Workshop
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is an important pillar of modern DevOps and is used by most enterprise customers to safely and efficiently provision and manage their cloud solutions. HashiCorp Terraform and Red Hat Ansible are very popular technologies allowing the practice of IaC - they abstract infrastructure provisioning, making it faster and easier for teams to deploy cloud resources in a variety of scenarios such as hybrid and multi cloud environments. In this workshop, learn about the practice of infrastructure as code, get an overview of Terraform, Ansible, and Azure Resource Manager templates, as well as gain hands-on experience in using these to deploy and provision resources on Azure. 

Walk throughs for this workshop can be found in the table below. During the workshop, you will pick a track or tool and work through each of the labs for that tool. If you have extra time during the workship or if you would like to come back and walk through the labs with the other tools after the workshop this table will enable you to do that.
